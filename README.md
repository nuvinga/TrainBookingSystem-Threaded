This application was built as partial completion of my 
first year reading for the B.Eng. (Hons) Software Engineering degree, from the 
University of Westminster.

### Application Background 
This application allows users to produce a train seat booking for a selective date.
The application is built for a Sri Lankan train route, overlooking the 
beautiful tracks from Colombo to Badulla, Sri Lanka. 

Once the dates have been selected, the user can select the journey destination,
and the start point.

Once both conditions have been successfully entered, the user can then proceed to 
select the seats they would like to book. The train consists of 42 seats, as specified in
the coursework specification. 

With the use of an `Array` of 42 indexes, the application will produce the view of the 
available seats. 

Since the application was developed while in first year, it does not adhere to all
the Object-Oriented Programming standard.
